# RGB Ceiling Light 
---

## 

The RGB LED used for the project belonged to an old ceiling light projector.

It included a powerful RGB LED, a green laser attached to a beam splitter, a microphone to sync the light to music, and a small motor with a piece of textured glass to refract and distort the light. I only used this LED, as well as an ESP32, connected to an [MQTT broker, hosted by a Raspberry Pi](../RPI%20MQTT%20Broker).
